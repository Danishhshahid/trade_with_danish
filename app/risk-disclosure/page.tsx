              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Trading foreign exchange (forex) carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade foreign exchange, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2">Market Risk:</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Forex markets are highly volatile and can move rapidly in response to economic, political, and social events. These movements can result in significant losses.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2">Leverage Risk:</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Forex trading often involves high leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses. A small market movement can result in substantial losses that exceed your initial investment.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2">Liquidity Risk:</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                While forex markets are generally liquid, there may be times when it is difficult to execute trades at desired prices, especially during volatile market conditions.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2">Counterparty Risk:</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                There is a risk that the broker or financial institution with which you trade may become insolvent or fail to meet its obligations.
